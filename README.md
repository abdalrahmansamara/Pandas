## Problem domain

get the data sets from kaggle website, download them into your project and start analyzing them as follows:

Start two Jupyter Notebooks called vg-stats and bike-stats, Add a markdown cell at the top of each notebook with the title of this assignment, an appropriate name for the data set, as well as your name and the date
Load up each of these data sets into a Pandas DataFrame within each respective file.

1. In the vg-stats notebook answer the following questions:

2. Which company is the most common video game publisher?

3. What’s the most common platform?

4. What about the most common genre?

5. What are the top 20 highest grossing games?

6. For North American video game sales, what’s the median?

7. For the top-selling game of all time, how many standard deviations above/below the mean are its sales for North America?
8. The Nintendo Wii seems to have outdone itself with games. How does its average number of sales compare with all of the other platforms?

In the bike-stats notebook, answer the following questions

1. What is the average trip duration for a borrowed bicycle?

2. What’s the most common age of a bicycle-sharer?

3. Given all the weather data here, find the average precipitation per month, and the median precipitation.

4. What’s the average number of bikes at a given bike station?

5. When a bike station is modified, is it more likely that it’ll lose bikes or gain bikes? How do you know?
